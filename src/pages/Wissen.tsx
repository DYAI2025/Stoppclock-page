            <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.5rem', marginBottom: '0.5rem' }}>History</h3>
            <p>The countdown was not invented by NASA, but by the German director Fritz Lang for his silent film "Frau im Mond" (Woman in the Moon) in 1929. He used the backward count as a purely dramatic device to build suspense before the fictional rocket launch. Rocket engineers and NASA later adopted the idea for real launches.</p>

            <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.5rem', marginBottom: '0.5rem' }}>Purpose</h3>
            <p>Countdown timers are used in various situations. In ancient Greece and Rome, water clocks were used in courtrooms to limit the speaking time of lawyers. The phrase "Time's up" originates from this practice. In modern times, countdowns are used in marketing to create a sense of urgency and drive sales, a phenomenon known as "Fear of Missing Out" (FOMO).</p>

                <li>The first public New Year's Eve countdown took place in 1957 at Times Square.</li>
                <li>The "Most Dangerous Writing App" is a writing timer that deletes all text if you stop typing for 5 seconds.</li>

            <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.5rem', marginBottom: '0.5rem' }}>Psychology</h3>
            <p>The Pomodoro Technique, developed by Francesco Cirillo, uses a timer to break down work into focused intervals, typically 25 minutes long, separated by short breaks. This method is designed to improve focus and prevent mental fatigue. Another relevant concept is Parkinson's Law, which states that "work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion." Using a countdown timer for timeboxing can help combat this tendency.</p>

            <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.5rem', marginBottom: '0.5rem' }}>History</h3>
            <p>The modern stopwatch was invented by Nicolas Rieussec in 1821. His device worked by putting a drop of ink on the dial to mark the time, which is why he called it a "chronograph" (time writer). However, an earlier device, the "Compteur de Tierces" created by Louis Moinet in 1816, was later discovered. It was able to measure time to 1/60th of a second.</p>

            <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.5rem', marginBottom: '0.5rem' }}>Purpose</h3>
            <p>A stopwatch, or chronograph, is a watch with a function to measure time intervals. It is used in sports, science, and industry to measure elapsed time with high precision. For example, TAG Heuer's "Mikrograph" was the first stopwatch to measure 1/100th of a second in 1916.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>A "chronometer" is not the same as a "chronograph." A chronometer is a high-precision watch that has been certified by an official body.</li>
                <li>The crew of Apollo 13 used their Omega Speedmaster chronographs to time a critical engine burn after their onboard digital timers failed.</li>

            <p>The first mechanical clocks were invented in the 13th century in European monasteries. They were so inaccurate that they only had an hour hand. The pendulum clock, invented by Christiaan Huygens in 1656, improved accuracy dramatically, making minute hands practical.</p>

            <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.5rem', marginBottom: '0.5rem' }}>Purpose</h3>
            <p>An analog clock provides a spatial representation of time, which can help in developing a better sense of time. It shows the relationship between the current time and the past and future, unlike a digital clock that only shows the present moment.</p>

            <p>The first chess clock was invented by Thomas Bright in 1883. It consisted of two pendulum clocks, and when one player made a move, they would stop their clock and start their opponent's. The modern digital chess clock was patented by Bobby Fischer in 1988.</p>
