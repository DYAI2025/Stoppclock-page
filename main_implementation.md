# Bootstrap Notes (Archived)

The original bootstrap instructions for this project have been superseded. For the current, truthful state of the codebase, please read:
- `README.md` for product/features overview and architecture
- `SSoT-Snapshot.md` for a compact status view
- `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` for extension patterns and checks

The repository already contains a working Vite + React + TypeScript setup with hash-based routing, timers, PWA shell, and Playwright tests; no additional bootstrap steps are required beyond `npm install` and `npm run dev`.
