Facts: Technology, History & Science of Time Ancient Timekeeping (Sun, Water, Fire) The world's simplest clock was a simple stick in the ground, a so-called gnomon.  Archaeologists found a limestone sundial over 3,200 years old in Egypt's Valley of the Kings.  In Egypt, sundials were also used to regulate work breaks during the peak midday heat.  Early sundials divided the day into 12 variable hours. A summer hour was therefore significantly longer than a winter hour.  A typical saying on sundials is: "Let others tell of storms and showers, I'll only count your sunny hours".  British troops in WWII used sundials in the desert because, unlike mechanical watches, they were immune to sand and dust.  A sundial shows "true solar time," which can deviate from our modern clock time by up to 16 minutes.  When the Romans captured a sundial from Sicily in 263 BC and set it up in Rome, it showed the wrong time for nearly 100 years. No one had considered that it needed to be calibrated for the new latitude.   The Tower of the Winds in Athens (c. 50 BC) combined eight sundials on its outer faces with a complex water clock inside for cloudy days.  The water clock is called a "Klepsydra," which is Greek for "water thief".  The philosopher Plato invented a water alarm clock around 380 BC to call his students. A mechanism dropped metal balls noisily onto a plate.    In ancient Greece and Rome, water clocks were used in courtrooms to limit the speaking time of lawyers.  Our phrase "Time's up" (Die Zeit ist abgelaufen) comes directly from the emptying of these court water clocks.     The Roman author Pliny the Younger proudly reported that he had several water clocks filled in succession for a five-hour speech.  To build an alarm clock from a candle, a nail was stuck into the candle at a specific height. When the wax melted, the nail fell onto a metal plate below.   In China, there were incense stick clocks. Sometimes different sections were scented with different fragrances, allowing one to literally "smell the time".   Mechanics, Horology & Stopwatches The first mechanical clocks were invented around 1300 in European monasteries.  The first documented mechanical clock struck in Milan in 1335.  Their purpose initially was not to display the time, but to strike bells to regulate working hours, markets, and the closing of city gates.  In the Islamic world, mechanical clocks were rarely integrated into mosques, as it was feared the ticking might undermine the authority of the Muezzin.  A young Galileo Galilei supposedly got the idea for the pendulum clock in 1583 while observing a swinging chandelier in the Pisa cathedral.   Christiaan Huygens built the first working pendulum clock in 1657, improving accuracy from minutes per day to about 10 seconds per day.   The "Chronograph" (stopwatch) was invented in 1821 by Nicolas Rieussec. His device used a nib that, at the press of a button, left an ink blot on the dial to "write" the time (Greek: graphein).    In 2012, it was discovered that Louis Moinet had already built a "Compteur de Tierces" in 1816. This device could measure 1/60th of a second, and its balance wheel vibrated at 216,000 vibrations per hour—six times faster than modern high-performance chronographs.   TAG Heuer's "Mikrograph" was the first stopwatch in 1916 capable of measuring 1/100th of a second.  The German company Hanhart produced the world's first affordable mechanical stopwatch in 1924.  A Chronograph is a watch with a stopwatch function.    A Chronometer is an official seal of quality for a watch that has been certified for extreme accuracy.    A Perpetual Calendar is a mechanical "memory" in a watch that knows the different lengths of months and even leap years. A correction is often not needed until the year 2100.    A Minute Repeater is a complex mechanism that chimes the time acoustically at the push of a button—originally developed to "hear" the time in the dark.   Timers, Countdowns & Productivity The countdown was invented in 1929 by director Fritz Lang for his silent film "Frau im Mond" (Woman in the Moon) to increase suspense before a fictional rocket launch.     A young Wernher von Braun was in the audience at the time and later, fascinated, adopted the idea for real rocket tests.  The first public New Year's Eve countdown took place in Times Square in 1957.  The Pomodoro Technique (25 min work, 5 min break) was invented in the 1980s by Francesco Cirillo.     It is named after his tomato-shaped kitchen timer (Italian: pomodoro = tomato).    The "52-17 Rule" (52 min work, 17 min break) emerged in 2014 from a data analysis of the most productive 10% of a company's users.   A repeat analysis in 2021 (after the pandemic and remote work shift) found a new optimal pattern: 112 minutes of work, followed by 26 minutes of break.   The "Tabata" protocol (8x 20 sec max effort, 10 sec rest) was originally developed for Japanese Olympic speed skaters.  Parkinson's Law states: "Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion". Timeboxing is the solution to this.   "The Most Dangerous Writing App" is a writing timer that deletes your entire text if you stop typing for 5 seconds.   The "Forest" app plants a virtual tree that dies if you leave the app—an "ecological guilt trip" as a motivator.  A study found that looking at cute baby animal pictures for 3 minutes can improve concentration and motor skills afterward.  Fun Facts & Anecdotes The "Clock of the South" on the congress building in La Paz, Bolivia, has been deliberately running backward since 2014. It is a political symbol of decolonization.      Spain lives in the "wrong" time zone. Dictator Franco moved the clocks forward one hour in 1940 to align with Nazi Germany. This "social jet lag" was never corrected.      In France, kissing on train platforms was banned in 1910 because passionate goodbyes were causing train delays.   From 1947 to 1949, Germany had a "High Summer Time" (Hochsommerzeit), where clocks were set two hours ahead of standard time to save energy.   Nepal's time zone is UTC+5:45. The 15-minute offset was chosen to be politically distinct from its neighbor India (UTC+5:30).   China geographically spans five time zones but uses only one across the entire country: Beijing Time (UTC+8).  At the border between China (UTC+8) and Afghanistan (UTC+4:30), the time difference is 3.5 hours when you take a single step.  The island nation of Kiribati moved the International Date Line in 1995 so it would no longer be split by the date. This created the time zone UTC+14, making it the first place to greet the New Year.    When you have a fever, your internal clock speeds up. The brain interprets this as the outside world moving more slowly.   As we age, time seems to speed up. One reason: our internal clock (metabolism, dopamine) slows down, making the external world appear to pass more quickly.   On the Monday after the switch to daylight saving time (spring), the incidence of heart attacks increases by up to 24%.  The stopwatch on an iPhone runs for over 99,000 hours before it resets to zero.  GPS & Relativity GPS systems would be useless without accounting for Einstein's theory of relativity and would produce daily errors of several kilometers.      Effect 1 (Special Relativity): Because of their high speed (approx. 14,000 km/h), the satellites' clocks tick 7 microseconds per day slower than on Earth.     Effect 2 (General Relativity): Because of the weaker gravity in orbit, the clocks tick 45 microseconds per day faster than on Earth.    The net effect is 38 microseconds (45 minus 7) that the satellite clocks run fast every day. This error must be permanently corrected.  Clocks in Crimes & Emergencies Apollo 13 (1970): After an explosion, the onboard digital clocks failed. The crew used their mechanical Omega Speedmaster chronographs to precisely time a life-saving 14-second engine burn, saving their lives.     The "Rolex-Killer" (1996): A murderer (Albert Johnson Walker) was convicted because his victim's Rolex automatic watch stopped running after his death. Forensics used the remaining power reserve (the stored energy) to precisely determine the time of death.     Aktenzeichen XY (1968): A murder case remained unsolved for decades until a gold watch found at the crime scene was shown years later on the TV show. A viewer recognized it as a family heirloom, which led to the killer's conviction.
