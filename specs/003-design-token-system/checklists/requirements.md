# Specification Quality Checklist: Design Token System & UI/UX Improvements

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

✅ **PASSED** - All checklist items validated successfully.

### Validation Notes

1. **Content Quality**: Specification focuses entirely on WHAT users need and WHY, without mentioning specific technologies (React, CSS modules, etc.). All descriptions are accessible to non-technical stakeholders.

2. **Requirement Completeness**: All 34 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-034) are testable and unambiguous. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all design decisions are clearly specified with exact values (colors, sizes, timing).

3. **Success Criteria**: All 14 success criteria (SC-001 through SC-014) are measurable with specific metrics (percentages, response times, counts). All are technology-agnostic - no mention of implementation details.

4. **User Stories**: 6 prioritized user stories cover the core flows (P0: Design Tokens, Countdown Input, Accessibility; P1: CTAs, Warnings, Chess Clock). Each story is independently testable with clear acceptance scenarios.

5. **Edge Cases**: 6 edge cases identified covering motion preferences, timezone displays, input validation, rapid interactions, audio autoplay, and migration strategy.

6. **Scope**: Feature clearly bounded to UI/UX improvements for existing timer components. Does not expand into new timer types or backend changes.

## Ready for Next Phase

✅ **Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`**

No blocking issues found. All mandatory sections complete with sufficient detail for planning and implementation.
