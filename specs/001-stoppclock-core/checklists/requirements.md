- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Review

✅ **No implementation details**: The spec focuses on WHAT the system must do (e.g., "System MUST provide Analog Countdown timer") without specifying HOW (no mention of React components, Canvas implementation details, etc. - these appear only in the dependencies section where appropriate).

✅ **User value focused**: All user stories clearly articulate user needs and business value (e.g., "teacher needs to project timer during exams", "user in low-connectivity venue needs offline access").

✅ **Non-technical language**: User scenarios and requirements use business language. Technical terms appear only where necessary (PWA, localStorage) and are standard web platform features.

✅ **Mandatory sections complete**: All required sections present:
- User Scenarios & Testing ✓
- Requirements (Functional + Key Entities) ✓
- Success Criteria ✓

### Requirement Completeness Review

✅ **No clarification markers**: Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers in the spec. All ambiguities were resolved using reasonable defaults documented in Assumptions section.

✅ **Testable requirements**: All 35 functional requirements are testable:
- FR-001: "provide Analog Countdown timer" → can test by verifying clock face renders
- FR-007: "configurable warning threshold (off, 1min, 5min, 10min)" → can test all 4 options
- FR-033: "run post-deployment smoke tests verifying 200 responses" → automated test validation

✅ **Measurable success criteria**: All 18 success criteria have concrete metrics:
- SC-001: "within 10 seconds" (time-based)
- SC-002: "50+ FPS" (performance metric)
- SC-007: "under 180 kB gzipped" (size metric)
- SC-017: "90% of users" (percentage metric)

✅ **Technology-agnostic success criteria**: Success criteria describe user/business outcomes without implementation details:
- ✓ "Users can set timer within 10 seconds" (not "React component renders in 10s")
- ✓ "Timer maintains 50+ FPS" (not "Canvas requestAnimationFrame achieves 50 FPS")
- ✓ "App functions offline" (not "Service Worker caches assets")

✅ **Acceptance scenarios defined**: 6 prioritized user stories with 25 total acceptance scenarios in Given/When/Then format.

✅ **Edge cases identified**: 10 edge cases documented covering boundary conditions, error scenarios, browser compatibility, and accessibility concerns.

✅ **Scope clearly bounded**: Out of Scope section explicitly excludes 13 categories of functionality (user accounts, native apps, cloud sync, etc.).

✅ **Dependencies and assumptions**:
- Dependencies section lists 8 technical dependencies with versions
- Assumptions section documents 18 assumptions about environment, configuration, and behavior

### Feature Readiness Review

✅ **Functional requirements with acceptance criteria**: All 35 FRs are tied to acceptance scenarios via user stories. For example:
- FR-001-012 map to User Story 1 acceptance scenarios
- FR-015-017 map to User Story 2 acceptance scenarios

✅ **User scenarios cover primary flows**: 6 user stories prioritized P1-P3 covering:
- P1: Core analog countdown with projection (primary use case)
- P2: Offline PWA capability (reliability requirement)
- P2: Privacy-first ad consent (differentiator)
- P3: Multi-tool state persistence, keyboard shortcuts, SEO (enhancement features)

✅ **Measurable outcomes align with success criteria**: Each P1-P2 user story has corresponding success criteria:
- User Story 1 → SC-001, SC-002, SC-003, SC-012
- User Story 2 → SC-005, SC-006, SC-007
- User Story 3 → SC-010

✅ **No implementation leakage**: Spec maintains separation between requirements and implementation:
- Spec says "MUST persist state" (requirement)
- Spec does NOT say "MUST use React Context API" (implementation)
- Technologies mentioned only in Dependencies section where appropriate

## Notes

**Status**: ✅ **SPECIFICATION READY FOR PLANNING**

All 14 checklist items pass validation. The specification is:
- Complete and comprehensive
- Testable and unambiguous
- Free of implementation details in requirements sections
- Well-documented with assumptions and dependencies
- Properly scoped with clear boundaries

**Minor Issues (Non-blocking)**:
- Two markdown linting warnings (MD034: bare URLs in Dependencies/Assumptions sections) - these are informational only and do not affect spec quality

**Recommended Next Steps**:
1. Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation design artifacts
2. OR proceed to `/speckit.tasks` to generate actionable task list
3. No clarifications needed - all ambiguities resolved with documented assumptions
