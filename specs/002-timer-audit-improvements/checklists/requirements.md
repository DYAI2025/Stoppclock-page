# Specification Quality Checklist: Stoppclock Timer Audit & Improvements

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Strengths**:
- Specification is comprehensive with 12 prioritized user stories (P0-P2)
- All 65 functional requirements are testable and clearly stated
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic (e.g., "within 100ms", "±2% accuracy", "95% auto-correction rate")
- Edge cases comprehensively cover storage limits, timezone changes, extreme values, multi-tab scenarios
- Clear scope boundaries with explicit "Out of Scope" and "Deferred" sections
- Assumptions section addresses technical, UX, and data considerations
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements have concrete defaults or clear specifications

**Quality Assessment**:
- All checklist items PASS
- Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase
- No blocking issues identified
- No clarifications needed - specification is complete and unambiguous

## Recommendation

✅ **APPROVED**: Specification is complete and ready for planning phase. Proceed with `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan.
