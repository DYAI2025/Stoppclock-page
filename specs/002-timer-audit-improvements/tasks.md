# Tasks: Stoppclock Timer Audit & Improvements

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-timer-audit-improvements/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: E2E tests using Playwright are requested and critical for this feature (spec mentions 44 existing tests, targeting 60+ after implementation).

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story. Stories follow P0 ‚Üí P1 ‚Üí P2 priority order.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Single-page web app with hash-based routing
- Source files in `src/` at repository root
- E2E tests in `tests/e2e/`
- Public assets in `public/`

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-14)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P0 ‚Üí P1 ‚Üí P2)
  - **P0 stories (US1-US5)**: Can all run in parallel after Foundational
  - **P1 stories (US6-US8, US11)**: Can all run in parallel after Foundational
  - **P2 stories (US9-US10, US12)**: Can all run in parallel after Foundational
- **Polish (Phase 15)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 (Countdown Keyboard)**: Independent - only depends on Foundational
- **US2 (World Clock)**: Independent - only depends on Foundational (uses WORLD_CLOCK_CITIES from T013)
- **US3 (Alarm)**: Independent - only depends on Foundational
- **US4 (Metronome)**: Independent - only depends on Foundational (uses audio context from T012)
- **US5 (Chess Clock)**: Independent - only depends on Foundational
- **US6 (Cycle Pause)**: Independent - modifies existing CycleTimer component
- **US7 (Stopwatch Persistence)**: Independent - modifies existing Stopwatch component
- **US8 (Analog Visual)**: Independent - modifies existing AnalogCountdown component
- **US9 (Countdown Validation)**: Can integrate with US1 or run independently
- **US10 (Keyboard Standardization)**: Depends on all timer pages existing (run after US1-US8)
- **US11 (PWA/Service Worker)**: Independent - affects all timers but doesn't require them
- **US12 (Dark/Light Mode)**: Independent - depends on T007-T008 (dark theme CSS)

### Within Each User Story

- E2E tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Data models/types before component logic
- Component implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: All 6 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: T007-T008 (CSS) can run parallel with T011-T013 (utilities)
- **After Foundational**: All P0 stories (US1-US5) can run in parallel = 5 parallel tracks
- **All E2E tests** within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- **Different user stories** can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 2 (World Clock)

```bash
# Launch all E2E tests for User Story 2 together:
Task T021: "Create World Clock E2E test file tests/e2e/05-world-clock.spec.ts"
Task T022: "Add test for default local timezone on page load"
Task T023: "Add test for timezone search and selection"
Task T024: "Add test for multi-timezone display (3+ cities)"
Task T025: "Add test for timezone persistence"
Task T026: "Add test for max 6 timezone limit"

# After tests fail, launch parallelizable implementation tasks:
Task T027: "Implement WorldClockState type and localStorage functions" (foundation)
Then in parallel:
Task T028: "Implement timezone search/filter UI"
Task T029: "Implement timezone selection handler"
Task T030: "Implement multi-clock display grid"
Task T031: "Implement clock update loop"
Task T032: "Add UTC offset calculation"
Task T033: "Add timezone removal button"
Task T034: "Add cross-tab sync"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T006)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T007-T013) - CRITICAL
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T014-T020)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Run E2E tests for Countdown keyboard shortcuts
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery (P0 Stories)

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add US1 (Countdown) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add US2 (World Clock) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add US3 (Alarm) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add US4 (Metronome) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. Add US5 (Chess Clock) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
7. All P0 blockers resolved! ‚úÖ

### Full Feature Delivery (All Stories)

After P0 stories complete:
- Add US6-US8, US11 (P1 stories) ‚Üí High-impact improvements
- Add US9-US10, US12 (P2 stories) ‚Üí UX polish
- Complete Phase 15 (Polish) ‚Üí Production-ready

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (T001-T013)
2. Once Foundational is done, split into parallel tracks:
   - **Developer A**: US1 (Countdown keyboard)
   - **Developer B**: US2 (World Clock)
   - **Developer C**: US3 (Alarm)
   - **Developer D**: US4 (Metronome)
   - **Developer E**: US5 (Chess Clock)
3. Each developer writes E2E tests first, then implements independently
4. Stories complete and integrate independently (no merge conflicts)

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies - can run in parallel
- **[Story] label**: Maps task to specific user story for traceability
- **E2E tests required**: Write tests first, ensure they FAIL before implementation
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Bundle size target: <180kB gzipped (check after Phase 15 completion)
- Test coverage target: 60+ E2E tests passing (currently 36/44 passing)
- Cross-tab sync: All timers must use useStorageSync hook for SC-015 compliance
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
