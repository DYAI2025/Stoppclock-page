# Pomodoro: Soft Focus Cycles

> This Pomodoro is here to support focus, not to judge your output.

## Character

The Pomodoro is like a steady heartbeat for your desk. It doesn't scream for efficiency or track your every click. Instead, it offers a gentle rhythm: a time to dive deep, and a time to step back and breathe. It is a tool for the "Soft Focus" – where work happens not through grinding, but through rhythmic intention.

## Rituals

### The Gentle Beginning
Before starting, take 30 seconds to breathe. Don't look at your task list yet. Just notice the room around you. Then, set the timer and let the first cycle begin.

### The Screen Shift
During the 5-minute break, look away from all screens. Look out of a window or close your eyes. The ritual is to reset the physical eyes, not just the brain.

### The Gratitude Gap
When the long break (15-20 min) starts, leave your desk entirely. Get a glass of water. Acknowledge that you've finished a set, regardless of how "productive" it felt.

## Effects

### Anti-Prokrastination
The hurdle to start a big task is lowered. The intention "I'll just work for 25 minutes" is easier to embrace than "I'll work all afternoon."

### Gamification (The Soft Way)
Each completed block is a small, tangible success. This activates the brain's reward system and builds gentle momentum.

### Focus Training
The strict boundary helps train the concentration muscle over time, while the mandatory breaks prevent mental exhaustion.

## Facts

### The Italian Tomato
The technique was developed in the 1980s by student Francesco Cirillo. He used a kitchen timer shaped like a tomato (pomodoro), which gave the method its iconic name.

### 25:5 – The Magic Ratio?
While 25/5 is the classic, research into the "52-17 rule" suggests different intervals might work better for others. Stoppclock lets you define your own rhythm.

### The "Flow" Danger
A common misconception is that breaks "break" flow. Actually, micro-breaks help maintain high-level focus over several hours without crashing.
