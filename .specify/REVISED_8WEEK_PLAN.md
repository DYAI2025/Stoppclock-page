## 🎓 AI SEO PRINCIPLES (APPLY TO ALL CONTENT)

### 1. Direct Answers First
Every piece of content should answer the question in first 50 words:

```
Q: How does Pomodoro work?
A: Pomodoro breaks work into 25-minute focused sessions
   followed by 5-minute breaks. This technique increases
   productivity by 40-70% based on neuroscience research.
```

### 2. Cite Your Sources
AI checks for verifiable claims:
```
✅ "MIT Study (2014): 25-minute focus windows are optimal"
❌ "Studies show Pomodoro is good"
```

### 3. Use Comparison Tables
AI loves structured data:
```
| Aspect | Pomodoro | Countdown |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Duration | 25 min | Flexible |
| Breaks | Built-in | Manual |
| Best for | Studying | Training |
```

### 4. Answer Counter-Arguments
Show you understand nuance:
```
"Pomodoro is great for most work, BUT NOT ideal for:
- Creative flow work (25 min too short)
- Deep problem-solving (needs 60+ min)
- Athletic training (needs longer blocks)"
```

### 5. Original Data Wins
AI strongly prefers original research:
```
✅ "Our survey of 500 students found..."
❌ "Many students use timers"
```
